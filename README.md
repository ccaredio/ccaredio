👋 Hi, I’m Christian Caredio.

💼 I’m currently the Data Engineer at Acme Marinas, where I’ve built our entire modern data stack from the ground up. My work spans data architecture, ELT pipelines, modeling, and business intelligence—owning the full data lifecycle.

🛠️ I work daily with tools like Snowflake, Azure Data Lake, dbt, Dagster, Fivetran, Hightouch, Sigma, and Python to deliver scalable, reliable data solutions that drive real business impact.

🌊 I successfully transitioned from a scientific background in oceanography into data engineering—leveraging my experience analyzing oceanographic data and automating workflows in Python to build a career in data.

📚 I’m currently deepening my Python skills and exploring streaming and batch processing patterns through personal projects that work with public APIs and real-time data.
