- 👋 Hi, I’m Christian Caredio. 
- 👀 I am a current data analyst with most of my role now consisting of the analytics engineering. I build clean actionable data models within dbt to be stored in Snowflake where I create KPI tracking dashboards and reports in Looker.  
- 🌱 I successfully leveraged my scientific background in analyzing oceanographic data to transition full-time into the data world. I am currently learning more about data engineering best practices with the goal of moving more into the engineering aspect of data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help expand my skills and knowledge within the data field.
